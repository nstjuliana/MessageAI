# Foreground Notifications Implementation Log

## Overview
Implementation of in-app notification banners for MessageAI that appear when users receive messages while the app is in foreground but not actively viewing the specific chat.

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and Working

---

## Files Created

### 1. `components/InAppNotification.tsx`
**Purpose:** Animated notification banner component

**Features:**
- Slides down from top with spring animation
- Shows sender avatar, name, and message preview
- Auto-dismisses after 4 seconds
- Tappable to navigate to chat
- Manual dismiss button (X)
- Uses native driver for 60 FPS animations

**Initial Location Issue:**
- ‚ùå First created in `src/components/InAppNotification.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Moved to `components/InAppNotification.tsx` to match TypeScript path mappings

### 2. `src/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx`
**Purpose:** State management for notifications and active chat tracking

**Key State:**
- `currentNotification` - The notification being displayed
- `activeChatId` - Chat user is currently viewing (for suppression)
- `lastProcessedMessageId` - Prevents duplicates

**Key Methods:**
- `showNotification(notification)` - Display notification with smart suppression
- `dismissNotification()` - Clear current notification
- `setActiveChatId(chatId)` - Register/unregister active chat

### 3. `src/hooks/useInAppNotifications.ts`
**Purpose:** Global message listener that triggers notifications

**Logic:**
- Listens to `onUserChatsSnapshot` for all user's chats
- Tracks `lastMessageTimestamp` per chat to detect new messages
- Skips notifications on initial load
- Fetches sender info and triggers notification display

### 4. `projectdesign/FOREGROUND_NOTIFICATIONS.md`
**Purpose:** Complete documentation of the notification system

### 5. `NOTIFICATION_DEBUG.md`
**Purpose:** Debug guide with testing steps and common issues

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/(authenticated)/_layout.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Added `NotificationProvider` wrapper around authenticated content
- Split into `AuthenticatedContent` component to access notification context
- Added `useInAppNotifications()` hook call
- Rendered `InAppNotification` component at top level
- Fixed import path: `@/components/InAppNotification` ‚Üí `../../components/InAppNotification`

### 2. `app/(authenticated)/chat/[chatId].tsx`
**Changes:**
- Imported `useNotifications` hook
- Added `useEffect` to register chat as active on mount
- Unregisters chat on unmount
- This suppresses notifications for the chat user is viewing

### 3. `src/types/chat.types.ts`
**Changes:**
- Added `lastMessageSenderId?: string` field to `Chat` interface
- Required for notifications to know who sent the last message

### 4. `src/services/chat.service.ts`
**Changes:**
- Updated `createMessage` to store `lastMessageSenderId` when updating chat metadata
- Updated all chat parsing functions to include `lastMessageSenderId` field

### 5. `src/services/message.service.ts`
**Changes:**
- Updated `updateChatLastMessage()` function signature to include `senderId` parameter
- Updated function to store `lastMessageSenderId` in chat document
- Updated both call sites to pass `message.senderId` parameter

---

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Problem 1: "Failed to fetch user profile" Error
**Symptom:**
```
Error fetching sender info for notification: Error: Failed to fetch user profile.
```

**Root Cause:** 
- Chat documents didn't have `lastMessageSenderId` field
- Notification hook was trying to fetch user with `undefined` ID

**Attempted Fix #1:**
- Added `lastMessageSenderId` to Chat type ‚úÖ
- Updated chat.service.ts to store sender ID ‚úÖ
- BUT still not working ‚ùå

**Attempted Fix #2:**
- Improved error handling in useInAppNotifications hook
- Added null checks for sender ID
- Added detailed logging

**Root Cause Discovery:**
```javascript
LOG  üìã Chat YzptV1k6zoYg73NkJ62b: {
  "senderId": undefined  // ‚Üê THE PROBLEM
}
```

**Final Fix:**
- Updated `message.service.ts` ‚Üí `updateChatLastMessage()` function
- Added `senderId` parameter to function signature
- Stored `lastMessageSenderId` in Firestore update
- Updated both call sites to pass sender ID

**Result:** ‚úÖ Sender ID now properly stored and retrieved

### Problem 2: Module Resolution Error
**Symptom:**
```
Cannot find module '@/components/InAppNotification' 
or its corresponding type declarations.
```

**Root Cause:**
- File initially created in wrong location (`src/components/`)
- TypeScript path alias `@/components/*` maps to `./components/*` not `./src/components/*`

**Fix #1:**
- Moved file from `src/components/` to `components/`
- Deleted incorrect file ‚úÖ

**Fix #2:**
- Changed import to relative path: `../../components/InAppNotification`
- Bypasses TypeScript path resolution issues
- Ensures Metro bundler can find the file

**Result:** ‚úÖ Import resolved successfully

### Problem 3: No Notifications Appearing
**Symptom:**
- No notifications showing despite messages arriving
- No errors in console

**Debugging Process:**
1. Added extensive console logging with emojis
2. Tracked notification flow through entire system
3. Discovered sender ID was undefined

**Console Logs Added:**
- üîî Notification setup
- üì¨ Chat updates received
- üîç Checking for new messages
- ‚ú® New message detected
- üìµ Notification suppressed (with reason)
- üéØ showNotification called
- üîî ‚úÖ Notification showing

**Result:** ‚úÖ Detailed logging helped identify root cause

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Context-Based State Management
**Why:** 
- Need to share notification state across entire app
- Need to track active chat from any screen
- React Context provides clean, type-safe API

### 2. Global Chat Listener (Not Per-Chat)
**Why:**
- More efficient than individual listeners per chat
- Single listener monitors all user's chats
- Firestore query already optimized for this pattern

### 3. Timestamp-Based New Message Detection
**Why:**
- Simple and reliable
- Works offline (timestamps persist in SQLite)
- Avoids complex message diffing logic

### 4. Initial Load Suppression
**Why:**
- Don't notify for existing messages on app open
- Only notify for messages that arrive after app is running
- Improves user experience

### 5. Optimistic UI Integration
**Why:**
- Messages appear immediately (existing behavior)
- Notifications work with existing optimistic update system
- No breaking changes to message sending flow

---

## Smart Suppression Logic

Notifications are suppressed when:

1. **Active Chat Match**
   - User is viewing the chat where message arrived
   - Checked via `activeChatId === notification.chatId`

2. **Own Messages**
   - Message is from current user
   - Checked via `chat.lastMessageSenderId === user.uid`

3. **Duplicate Notifications**
   - Same notification triggered multiple times
   - Tracked via `lastProcessedMessageId` ref

4. **Initial Load**
   - Existing messages on app startup
   - Tracked via `isInitialLoad` flag

5. **Missing Data**
   - No sender ID in chat document
   - No sender profile found in Firestore
   - Gracefully logged and skipped

---

## Data Flow

```
1. User A sends message
   ‚Üì
2. message.service.ts ‚Üí sendMessageOptimistic()
   ‚Üì
3. Updates Firestore message document
   ‚Üì
4. Updates Firestore chat document with lastMessageSenderId
   ‚Üì
5. chat.service.ts ‚Üí onUserChatsSnapshot fires for User B
   ‚Üì
6. useInAppNotifications hook detects new message
   ‚Üì
7. Checks if User B is viewing that chat (activeChatId)
   ‚Üì
8. Fetches sender profile from Firestore
   ‚Üì
9. Calls NotificationContext.showNotification()
   ‚Üì
10. InAppNotification component renders and animates
   ‚Üì
11. Auto-dismisses after 4 seconds
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Notification appears when message received on chat list
- [x] Notification suppressed when in active chat
- [x] Notification shows sender avatar and name
- [x] Tapping notification navigates to chat
- [x] Manual dismiss button works
- [x] Auto-dismiss after 4 seconds
- [x] Own messages don't trigger notifications

## Performance Considerations

### Memory
- Single notification state (not queued)
- Uses refs for timestamps (no re-renders)
- Cleanup on component unmount

### Network
- Reuses existing chat snapshot listeners
- No additional Firestore queries except sender fetch
- Sender fetch is one-time per notification

### Rendering
- Animations use native driver (60 FPS)
- Component only mounts when notification exists
- Position absolute (no layout shifts)
- No re-renders during animation

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Single Notification Display**
   - Only shows one notification at a time
   - Latest notification replaces previous one
   - Could implement queue in future

2. **Old Messages Won't Notify**
   - Messages sent before this feature was deployed don't have `lastMessageSenderId`
   - These will be skipped gracefully
   - Fixed once new message is sent in that chat

3. **No Notification Persistence**
   - Notifications disappear on app restart
   - No notification history
   - Could add notification center in future

---

## Code Statistics

**Lines Added:** ~450
**Files Created:** 5
**Files Modified:** 5
**Console Logs Added:** 15+

---

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Push Notifications** - For backgrounded/closed app
2. **Notification Queue** - Show multiple notifications sequentially
3. **Grouping** - "3 new messages from John"
4. **Sound/Haptics** - Optional notification sounds
5. **Notification Center** - View notification history
6. **Custom Actions** - Quick reply, mark as read
7. **Badge Counts** - Show unread counts on chat list
8. **Priority Messages** - Special styling for @mentions

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Path Aliases are Tricky** - Always verify TypeScript paths match actual file structure
2. **Data Schema Matters** - Missing `lastMessageSenderId` caused entire feature to fail
3. **Logging is Essential** - Detailed console logs made debugging 10x faster
4. **Test with Fresh Data** - Old database records won't have new fields
5. **Error Handling First** - Graceful failures prevent cascading issues
6. **Metro Bundler Cache** - Sometimes needs restart after file moves
