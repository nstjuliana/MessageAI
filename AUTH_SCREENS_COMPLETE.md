### Error Messages

**Sign Up Errors:**
- "Email is required"
- "Please enter a valid email address"
- "Password is required"
- "Password must be at least 6 characters"
- "Please confirm your password"

## Firebase Integration

Both screens integrate with the tested auth service:
- `signUp(email, password)` - Creates new Firebase user
- `signIn(email, password)` - Authenticates existing user

All Firebase errors are caught and displayed with user-friendly messages:
- "This email is already registered. Please sign in instead."
- "No account found with this email. Please sign up first."
- "Incorrect password. Please try again."
- "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."
